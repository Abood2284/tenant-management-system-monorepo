# Project Overview

The proposed project involves developing a web-based Tenant Management System to replace the existing desktop solution. This new platform will streamline the management of properties, tenants, and rent transactions. The system will feature modules for property management and categorization, tenant management, rent billing, and financial transactions.

Admin will be able to add and manage properties by defining key attributes. Tenants can be added with assigned rent structures and linked to specific properties. Billing can be generated based on property and billing cycle, and payment transactions recorded manually with the system. Additionally, the system will support WhatsApp integration for sending rent reminders, outstanding alerts, and payment receipts.
